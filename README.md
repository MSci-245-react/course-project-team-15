TasteOfLoo - Team 15 MSCI 342 Group Project
By: Ethan Teo, Mason Au, Kiranjit Nagra

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

With the busy lives of students, eating healthy and desirable food can be a challenge. Therefore, we decided to create a web app that helps students choose a restaurant through a diverse amount of filters. In addition, students can write and see the reviews of restaurants to make their ultimate decision on where to eat. Also, students can track their expenses by accessing their purchase history. 

Unlike our competitors, our app is catered to students in Waterloo. This means that the restaurant reviews are made by like-minded individuals so that users can get the best possible recommendations. In addition, due to our expertise in the Waterloo Region, we are able to notify students on various ways to save money such as through restaurant promotions and include student discounts.
